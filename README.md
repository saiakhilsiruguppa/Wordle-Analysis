Have you ever played a game of Wordle and wondered 'Hmm, so what should my first word be so that I have the best chance of getting this one right?'. Well I had the same thought in my head and I started crunching some numbers (and letters) to find an answer to this question. Though there's no right answer, there definitely is a best one! For anyone who is reading this for the first time, Wordle is a simple word game where you have 6 chances to guess the word right. The rules are simple and the website (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) explains them well.
